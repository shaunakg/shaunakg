# Hi

I'm a student developer and I create immersive websites that benefit people. Some of the projects I'm most proud of are:

- [Cardz - an educational platform for students to create flashcards with machine learning](https://srg.id.au/posts/building-cardz/)
- SixtySecondShell - try out any programming language for a minute ([Backend](https://git.io/J8iX0), [Frontend](https://git.io/J8iXK))
- [Studyboard - an aesthetic board for students](https://git.io/J8iMu)
- [COVID-19 Anonymous Notifier](https://github.com/shaunakg/covid-19-anonymous-notifier)
- [Notion Reading List syncing integration](https://srg.id.au/notion-reading-list/)
- Various [educational utilities for Notion](https://edutools.srg.id.au/)

I have a personal website at [srg.id.au](https://srg.id.au) where you can learn more about me.
